    Raise this only from a callback registered with
    ``AsyncClient.add_event_admission_callback()``, before durable acceptance
    and before producing or scheduling side effects.
    Limited-timeline recovery keeps the event pending for redispatch.
    Raising this from an ordinary event callback is too late to reject the
    event and therefore has ordinary callback-error behavior.
    An ordinary error from a live callback acknowledges that event once, while
    an ordinary error from recovered history leaves it pending for a later
    pump or restart.
